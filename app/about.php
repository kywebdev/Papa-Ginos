                            <p>When Michael Valerio’s family emigrated from Italy to Boston, they brought along authentic Italian family recipes handed down through generations. These were the recipes Michael and his wife, Helen, used when they opened their first pizzeria, Piece O' Pizza, in East Boston in 1961. This restaurant soon became known throughout Boston as the place to go for the best, most authentic pizza around.</p>

                                <p>When Mike Valerio and his wife opened the first Papa Gino’s in 1961 in East Boston, they used the recipes that his family brought over from Italy in the 1930’s. That pizza recipe has never changed and is still being used today. That’s why every Papa Gino’s pizza still has that same distinctive, authentic Italian taste. So the pizza you grew up with is the same pizza you feed your family.</p>

                            <p>What makes our pizza special? It’s in the details. Details like traditional dough, made fresh daily right here in Walpole, Mass. using only five simple ingredients: locally-milled hard winter wheat flour, water, yeast, salt and oil. Our specially crafted tomato sauce made from vine-ripened California crushed tomatoes. Top that with our signature blend of three premium cheeses for an authentic pizza with the uniquely delicious taste you won’t get anywhere else.</p>
