                                <p>Since its founding in 1948, the Jimmy Fund has raised millions of dollars for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through thousands of grassroots efforts, helping to save lives and give hope to cancer patients around the world. Thanks to the Jimmy Fund, Dana-Farber has the resources to provide expert, compassionate care to children and adults and is home to groundbreaking cancer discoveries.</p>
                                <p>In 2015, Papa Gino's and D'Angelo Grilled Sandwiches reached the major milestone of over $1 million raised to support Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Jimmy Fund.</p>
                                <h3>Giving Back for a Great Cause</h3>
                                <p>Right now Papa Gino's guests can add a $1 donation or more with their orders to support cancer care and research at Dana-Farber Cancer institute and the Jimmy Fund.</p>
                                <p>100% of the funds raised through this program will be used for charitable purposes at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. located at 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, (617) 632-3000. The Papa Gino's/D'Angelo Donation Program is being conducted by a Commercial Co-Venturer.</p>

                                <p>Caiya is currently receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at Dana-Farber's Jimmy Fund Clinic. For Caiya, the Jimmy Fund Clinic is a special place because she feels safe there. Hailing from Hanover, Mass, she enjoys arts and crafts, foxes, the Boston Red Sox, music, and spending time outside. She's excited to be this year's Papa Gino's Patient Ambassador, not only because she loves our Cheese Pizza and Breadsticks, but because the money raised will help patients like her.</p>
